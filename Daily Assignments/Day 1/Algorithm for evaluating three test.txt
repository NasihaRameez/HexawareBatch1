Algorithm for evaluating three test marks and reassessment:
1. Start.
2. Input three test marks m1, m2, m3.
3. Calculate the average avg= (m1+m2+m3) / 3.
4. Check if avg â‰¥ 75.
If yes, print avg and go to step 7
If no, go to the next step
5. Reassessment is required.
6. Input new marks m1, m2 and m3, repeat from step 3.
7. End
