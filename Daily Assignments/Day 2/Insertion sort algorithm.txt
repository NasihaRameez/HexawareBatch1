Insertion Sort Algorithm
1. Begin.
2. Take the 2nd element and compare it with the previous element. If it is smaller, shift it to the left.
3. Take the 3rd element and compare it with the previous elements. If it is smaller, shift it to the correct position.
4. Take the next element, compare it with previous elements, and shift it accordingly.
5. Continue until all elements are sorted.
6. End.
